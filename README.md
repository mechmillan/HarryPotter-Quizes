A short collection of Python scripts used to practice trivia questions for the Harry Potter books. 
I used this with some friends to quickly practice for a Harry Potter Trivia Night (came in 5th out of ~30 groups). 

TODO:
- Add more questions
- Find better format for storing answers
- Create an interactive website around the quizzes
